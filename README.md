# Machine Learning Projects 🧠📊

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** repository! This repo contains hands-on implementations of various ML models and core concepts that I built while learning data science and machine learning. Each model is built from scratch or with the help of libraries like `scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and is documented using **Jupyter Notebooks** for easy understanding and reproducibility.
